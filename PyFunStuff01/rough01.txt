#lab 5Exercise 2: Numeric File Analysis
#Obtain a file name from the user, which will contain data pertaining
#     to a 2D grid of numbers
#Store the information from the file in a list of lists of floats
#Create a file for each of the following:
#averages.txt : contains the overall average of the entire array,
#               then the average of each row
#reverse.txt : contains the original values but each row is reversed
#flipped.txt : contains the original values but is flipped top to
#             bottom (first row is now the last row etc.)
#If the dimensions of array are symmetric (NxN),
#create a diagonal.txt: contains the array mirrored on the diagonal
